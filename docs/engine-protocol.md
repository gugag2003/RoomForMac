# RoomForMac engine protocol (v1)

RoomForMac drives its bundled, patched Mole engine (`build/engine`, shipped as
`RoomForMac.app/Contents/Resources/engine`) through environment variables and reads
machine-readable results. This is the contract between `patches/mole/` and
`Packages/MoleEngine`.

## Invoking the engine

| Purpose | Executable | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Smart Clean preview | `bin/clean.sh --dry-run` | events file |
| Smart Clean run | `bin/clean.sh` with `MOLE_SELECTION_FILE` | events file |
| App inventory | `bin/uninstall.sh --list` | JSON array on stdout |
| Uninstall preview / run | `bin/uninstall.sh [--dry-run]` with `MOLE_UNINSTALL_APP_PATHS_FILE` | events file |
| Disk level | `bin/analyze-go --json [PATH]` | one JSON document on stdout |
| Move to Trash | `bin/analyze-go --trash-list FILE` | events on stdout |
| Live status | `bin/status-go --watch --interval 2s` | one JSON snapshot per line on stdout |

Every command runs with `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`, `NO_COLOR=1`,
`TERM=dumb`, stdin `/dev/null`, its own process group, and `PATH` = test prefixes, then
`host-bin/` (while admin access is off), then Homebrew and system directories.

## Host variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MOLE_GUI_HOST=roomformac` | A GUI drives the run; `force_kill_app` skips its AppleScript Quit (the host quits apps itself). |
| `MOLE_NO_AUTH=1` | Every sudo entry point refuses without prompting (`mole_auth_disabled`). Always paired with `host-bin/sudo`. |
| `MOLE_JSON_EVENTS_FILE=PATH` | Append events (below) to PATH, one JSON object per line. |
| `MOLE_SELECTION_FILE=PATH` | NUL-separated absolute paths. Deletion sinks refuse any other path; tool-driven cleanups are skipped. |

The host creates every file it passes with mode `0600` inside a fresh `0700` directory.

### Host helpers (patch 0001)

Patch 0001 adds `lib/core/host.sh` (sourced by `lib/core/common.sh`) and the two switches
above. It only provides the building blocks: engine commands start writing events with
patch 0002, and deletion sinks start enforcing the selection with patch 0003. With none of
the host variables set, the engine behaves exactly like Mole `V1.56.0`.

| Helper | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `mole_json_escape STR`, `mole_json_str STR` | JSON string body, or the quoted literal. Escapes `\`, `"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t` and every other byte `0x01`–`0x1f` as `\u00xx`, in any locale; all other bytes (UTF-8 included) pass through unchanged. |
| `mole_json_num N` | `N` as a JSON integer without leading zeros; anything but a plain non-negative integer becomes `0`. |
| `mole_json_bool B` | `true` for the string `true`, otherwise `false`. |
| `mole_json_emit LINE` | Appends `LINE` and a newline to `MOLE_JSON_EVENTS_FILE`; does nothing when the variable is unset. A failed write never fails the run. |
| `mole_selection_allows PATH` | Always succeeds without `MOLE_SELECTION_FILE`. With it, succeeds only when `PATH`, ignoring trailing slashes, equals one listed path; parents and children of a listed path are refused. |
| `mole_auth_disabled` | True with `MOLE_NO_AUTH=1` (or Mole's own test switches). `request_sudo_access`, `request_sudo_access_with_password`, `has_sudo_session`, `adopt_sudo_session`, `ensure_sudo_session` and `ensure_sudo_session_with_password` then fail without running `sudo`. |
| `force_kill_app` | With `MOLE_GUI_HOST` set to any non-empty value, skips the AppleScript Quit; the SIGTERM and SIGKILL ladder that follows is unchanged (its `sudo -n` retry fails at `host-bin/sudo`). |

Selection file format: each absolute path followed by a NUL byte. Paths may contain any
other byte (spaces, quotes, backslashes, newlines, UTF-8). Empty entries and a final path
without its NUL are ignored. The engine reads the file once, on its first lookup, so the
host writes it completely before starting the engine. A missing, unreadable, non-regular
or symlinked selection file allows nothing.

## JSON conventions

- One object per line, UTF-8, first key `"v":1`. Hosts skip lines they cannot parse and types they do not know.
- Strings escape `"`, `\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, and other control bytes as `\u00XX`.
- Sizes are integer kilobytes (`size_kb`); booleans are JSON booleans.
- A run is complete only when its `summary` event arrived and the process exited 0.
